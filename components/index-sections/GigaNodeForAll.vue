            Giga Node For All
          </h3>
        
          <p class="p--accent mb-4">
            We built a reliable, secure, fault-tolerant, robust and geographically
            distributed infrastructure that capable of processing most of the day-to-day
            operations on the Tezos network including the peak times at the beginning of each cycle.
          </p>
        
          <p>
            Moreover, this will simplify the onboarding process for all new dApps and services
            that are planned to be migrated or built on Tezos.
          </p>
        
          <p>
            In essence, the idea that we have in mind is to turn the GigaNode
            into a fully decentralized solution, which will be given back to
            the community once it is finished, while completely removing
            Tezos Ukraine as a single point of failure.
